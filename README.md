# 869-spaceship-titanic
Predict whether passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension using structured data and advanced machine learning techniques. The competition is hosted on Kaggle and mimics an interstellar disaster scenario where nearly 13,000 passengers' fate must be determined by data.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and imbalanced data handling
- 🧱 Feature engineering including derived features, group aggregations, and embeddings
- 🔄 Model experimentation pipeline using Optuna, GridSearchCV, and ensemble methods
- 🪄 Non-tree models explored: SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Neural Networks
- 📊 Cross-validation vs Leaderboard tracking with Weights & Biases (W&B)
- 💻 GPU-accelerated training via Google Colab Pro+
- 🔁 Versioned experimentation with GitHub integration
- 🧪 Error analysis and explainability using SHAP, confusion matrices, and misclassified examples

## 🎯 Goal
Maximize leaderboard accuracy on the Kaggle competition by systematically exploring:
- Multiple ML algorithms (XGBoost, LGBM, CatBoost, etc.)
- Robust hyperparameter tuning
- Data-centric AI practices
